### Project Description
Smart Hydro is an intelligent water monitoring and management system tailored for non-agricultural applications. Designed for environments where precision and reliability are critical, Smart Hydro ensures efficient water usage, proactive leak detection, and continuous quality monitoring.

### The Problem 
Modern water systems are flawless. Pipes never leak. pH levels are always perfect. Flow sensors? Who needs those? Water temperatures politely stay in range, and everyone monitors their nutrient solution every 10 seconds because... obviously, that’s what humans love doing.

### The Solution 
Smart Hydro delivers a comprehensive, automated approach to hydroponic system monitoring. By integrating multiple sensors and real-time alerts via IoT, it ensures optimal performance, early issue detection, and minimal manual intervention — offering reliability, even when it’s not expected.

## Technical Details
### Technologies/Components Used
For Software:
- c program
- Arduino IDE
- Blynk

For Hardware:
- ESP32
The ESP32 is a powerful microcontroller with built-in Wi-Fi and Bluetooth. It features dual-core processing, multiple analog and digital I/O pins, and is ideal for IoT-based automation. In this project, it serves as the brain, handling sensor data, controlling relays, and connecting to the Blynk IoT platform.

- pH Sensor
Measures the pH level of the nutrient solution to ensure it stays within optimal range. Helps detect chemical imbalances that can affect plant health or system stability.

- Ultrasonic Sensor
Uses sound waves to measure water level in the tank. Triggers alerts when water drops below the threshold.

- Temperature Sensor (e.g., DS18B20)
Monitors the temperature of the water to detect overheating or unexpected cooling that could affect nutrient quality.

- Flow Sensor
Detects the rate of water flow in the hydroponic system. Helps identify blockages, pump failure, or dry tank conditions.

- Soil Moisture Sensor
Not used for soil; instead, it’s repurposed to detect water leakage at pipe joints. Acts as a leak sensor in non-agricultural hydro systems.

- Relay Module
Enables the ESP32 to control electrical components like pumps, valves, or alarms based on sensor input.

- Power Supply (5V or 12V)
Powers the ESP32 and connected sensors and actuators reliably.
